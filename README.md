# SendPass [Tool for sending saved Wi-Fi passwords to a Telegram bot🌐]
**`This PowerShell script simplifies retrieving stored Wi-Fi network passwords and sending them securely to your Telegram bot.😁`**
It operates discreetly by minimizing the PowerShell window during execution. After a brief pause, the script retrieves the password, exits PowerShell automatically, and sends the password directly to your Telegram bot for easy access. (Tested on the latest version of Windows 11)

Replace the @BotFather("TOKEN @rmsup") and @userinfobot("ID @secbaz") in lines 1 and 2 and save the file.

Then run the tool in Windows PowerShell and wait for the password to be sent to you.

It can also be used for HID (Human Interface Device) attacks.

>Use it for educational purposes and have fun.🫣
